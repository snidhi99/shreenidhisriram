              "Shreenidhi interned with my Amazon team in the summer of 2022. She was an excellent member of the team and I was impressed with her detailed understanding of the problem domain and our user's needs. She deep-dived on the problem and was not afraid to challenge pre-existing assumptions about the best solution for her project. In the end she delivered a solution that spanned multiple systems and simplified one of the complex metadata modeling processes for our users."
