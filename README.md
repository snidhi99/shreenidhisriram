# Personal Website
Hi! Thanks for visiting! I'm proud to present the first iteration of my website. There is still much I would like to add, so please stay tuned. 

## TODO
##### *Not in an particular order*
* Add a section for interests
* Modularize the timeline so it's easier to add/remove new elements
* Make tooltip in timeline more reactive
* Make more user-friendly for mobile
* Fix scrolling
